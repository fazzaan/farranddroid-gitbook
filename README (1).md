# Decreasing Distraction

Reclaim your attention by removing as many distracting things as possible.

Distracting things include:

* unnecessary graphics and animations
* unnecessary colours, especially those which move
* unnecessary transparency effects
* slow, flashy & fancy animations
* unnecessary objects, items, widgets, attention-grabbers
* anything which gets in the way of fluent work

However, stripping back too many things can also make the OS interface a bit too "bare" and lose some of the features which make it more intuitive.

I'll show you how to alter these settings, and leave it up to you to decide how much you want to tweak.
