# Registry editors

Windows's own registry editor is very basic and has no complex features. You can't open multiple tabs, you can't undo, you can return to previous registry states. So far, I have found one alternative registry editor, with amazing features. It becomes much safer to edit your registry using this app instead because you can easily undo the changes you made (unless the changes made it impossible to boot!).

Visit [their website](https://registry-finder.com/) to download and try it out.

You can run it as a user, as the administrator, and you can even tell it to replace RegEdit.
