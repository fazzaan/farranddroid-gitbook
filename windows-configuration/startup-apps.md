# Startup Apps

Disable as many as possible!

Look at each one properly and think about what it is and if it needs to start up automatically.

If you don't recognize anything, search for it online!

Some of the startup apps are necessary, such as audio controllers and antivirus apps.

* RtkAudUService — Realtek Audio service
* SecurityHealthSystray — Windows Security

Some of the apps are ones that you installed and maybe want to start up automatically.

* GoogleDriveFS — Google Drive desktop synchronization
* wincompose — WinCompose keyboard app
* Telegram Desktop

Many are apps that Microsoft or other companies want to start up, but you might not.

* Phone Link&#x20;
* Xbox
* Microsoft Teams
* Skype

Disable as many as possible!
