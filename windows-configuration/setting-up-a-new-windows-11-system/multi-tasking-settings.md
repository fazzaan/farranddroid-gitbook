### Snap windows settings

These are my "Snap windows" settings.

1. The first one is unnecessary, annoying, and sometimes causes brief lag.&#x20;
2. The second is also annoying and unnecessary.
3. The third one is exceptionally annoying, as it often interferes with where I'm trying to move the window to. It also causes a lot of lag on lower-spec computers.
4. The fourth is very useful because this allows you to quickly return to your snapped layout. E.g. if you snapped Chrome to the left and Notepad to the right, this allows you to choose that snapped layout again after using a different window.
5. The fifth is useful if you are using a touchscreen. Personally, I position my windows carefully, sometimes including near to the edge. If you are using a mouse, hitting the edge of the screen is easy (see [_Fitts's Law_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law)). This setting makes the snap region much wider than the edge of the screen, which regularly interferes with dragging the window around.

### Tabs from apps settings

Don't show tabs. This is one of the most annoying features in the world, especially if you are a power user. This feature breaks the hierarchy paradigm of where each item resides — and it also makes no effort whatsoever to clarify where the tabs come from.&#x20;

App windows exist in the computer desktop space, and tabs exist inside the windows. Tabs should not be accessible from outside of their parent windows — or, if they are, then it should be abundantly clear which application they belong to.

This feature also does not work consistently across all apps that have tabs, which further contributes to breaking your mental hierarchy paradigm of where items and pages reside.&#x20;

Unless you actually like this and are already familiar with using it, turn it off. You will have fewer headaches and will be able to reflexively find things.&#x20;

Interestingly, this is yet another example of new features from Microsoft which serve to disable our reflexive functions and force us to operate instead via observation and processing. Another example of this is their centring of the Taskbar items, untethering the Start button from a static, predictable and infinitely large location (again, see [_Fitts's Law_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law)).
