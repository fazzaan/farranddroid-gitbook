# Setting up a new Windows 11 system

If you're anything like me, you'll have noticed there's a whole bunch of annoying af default settings in Windows. Gok knows _why_ it's like this, but like this is it. Having set up a bunch of new Windows installations for myself over the last few weeks, I've decided to share my personal configurations with you.

* Multi-tasking settings
* Touchpad gestures â€” useful & intuitive
* Language & Keyboard settings
  * Custom keyboard layouts
* Useful apps to make you into a "power-user"
* Upgrading Windows to a better version
* Media apps for streaming downloaded videos from your computer to your TV, phone, tablet
