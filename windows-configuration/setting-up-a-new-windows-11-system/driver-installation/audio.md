## Nahimic Audio

_**Hear me out.**_&#x20;

Firstly, I must say that the software backend for this is horrendous and I hate it with a vengeance.

Secondly, I must say that the speakers on my laptop are very quiet unless I have Nahimic installed. In Linux, the system can't even find all the speaker outputs, the sound is barely audible. My 2017 phone is louder.

The sound effects and optimizations are pretty nice.&#x20;

And the microphone noise cancellation is pretty good. My laptop has stereo mic input, so it can do lateral sound cancellation.
