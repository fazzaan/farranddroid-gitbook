# Driver Installation

If you have bought a second-hand or refurbished computer, or if you have just installed a fresh copy of Windows, you will need to check that all the right hardware drivers are installed.

These days, the Windows Update service is rather good at installing all the correct drivers for your specific machine, but occasionally there are some drivers that it can't find, or that install incorrectly.

Sometimes there are additional apps from the OEM which dramatically improve hardware functionality and even enable otherwise-inaccessible features.

Some tech shops really are too lazy to do this process for you.
