# Windows Upgrade

You can upgrade your Windows installation here:

[github / massgravel / Microsoft-Activation-Scripts](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)&#x20;

or

[massgrave.dev](https://massgrave.dev/)

It uses a loophole in Microsoft's own activation system.

Microsoft continue to handicap us by restricting us from accessing fundamental settings on the cheaper versions of Windows.&#x20;

For example, many annoying features & behaviours of Windows are only modifiable via GPE (Group Policy Editor), but that app cannot run in Windows Home Edition.

You can overcome these limitations by upgrading to Pro Edition.

MassGrave features a permanent OS activation method.
