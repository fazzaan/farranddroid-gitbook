# Removing Bloatware

Many computer companies ship their computers & laptops with all kinds of "bloatware" pre-installed, apps and extensions which you don't really want or need.&#x20;

Some are inert and just want to advertize and spread their reach, in hopes of growing their user base and prospective paying-customer base.

But some are legalized spyware, generating telemetry on your computer usage and personal behaviours, sending it back to the mothership. And, as you should have noticed over the last 5 years (\~2019—2024), most big companies are now more interested in data than anything else — and they're using this data to generate LLMs (Large Language Models) and similar, neural network data cores that have been misrepresented as "Artificial Intelligence" in an attempt to humanize and personify these giant models of human knowledge and human behaviour.

Again, watch Westworld to see what I mean.

### Adobe Acrobat

Everybody and their toaster can read PDFs these days. There's very little in Adobe Acrobat that most people really need. Even having it installed means that Adobe have an "updater service" running in the background all the time.

Acrobat also installs a Chrome (etc) browser extension, to view PDFs inside your web browser. It probably adds a few features that aren't available in Google's and Microsoft's built-in PDF viewers...&#x20;

But, Adobe's extension ALSO uses 500+ MB of RAM when you don't even have it open!

That is honestly insane. It's not even being used yet it takes up a sizeable portion of your computer's memory. On one laptop, with 6GB RAM, that is a significant amount!

Remove the extension.

Consider uninstalling Adobe Acrobat altogether.
