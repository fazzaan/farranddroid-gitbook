# Browser Extensions

Browsers are now the home of most people's daily computer usage.

Browser extensions bring extra features to your internet lifestyle, and can dramatically alter & improve the way you experience it.

Here's some of my favourite extensions:

* [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) — Pretty much the best way to block ads across the web. \[[github](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)]
* [Google Translate](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb) — in-page popup translator box for selected text.
* [ABookmark](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/abookmark-everything-is-a/poeodakgiedndmmkabehagjgpbjkcfgg) — clean up your bookmarks, removing duplicates, etc. \[[website](https://www.abookmark.org/)]
* [Language Reactor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/language-reactor/hoombieeljmmljlkjmnheibnpciblicm) — shows subtitles in two languages at the same time in Netflix, YouTube, and other video streaming platforms. Has a lot of features to help with studying languages.&#x20;
* [Google Search Keyboard Shortcuts](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-search-keyboard-sh/iobmefdldoplhmonnnkchglfdeepnfhd) — Adds keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys back to Google search results. \[[github](https://github.com/jchafik/google-search-shortcuts)]
