# Power User mentality

1. As a power user, you want to <mark style="color:red;">automate simple & repetitive tasks</mark>, either to reflexive repeated sequences of actions, or to an actual automated service.
2. As a power user, you want to <mark style="color:orange;">use a combination of input methods</mark> (mouse, touchpad, touchscreen, keyboard, keyboard layouts), and you want to use each of them to their fullest potential.
3. As a power user, you want to <mark style="color:yellow;">be capable of using either hand for any input device at any moment</mark>, able to use both hands with equal dexterity, speed and accuracy.
4. As a power user, you want to <mark style="color:green;">minimize external & internal distractions</mark>, and you also want to <mark style="color:green;">be adaptable and imperturbable</mark>.

## How to develop these abilities

### 1. Automating tasks

First you will learn some keyboard shortcuts for regular functions. Copy, cut & paste you should already know by now! There are also basic formatting shortcuts, many of which also exist in "Markdown" formatting. As you master touch-typing and these keyboard shortcuts, you will combine the skills naturally and suddenly you'll find yourself capable of doing some tasks very quickly, especially if you do them often or in a repeating sequence!

It is also worth taking a few moments or minutes to consider the task ahead of you.&#x20;

* Does it contain repetition?&#x20;
* Can you break it into repeatable sequences?&#x20;
* Will those sequences be too long or too complex to repeat accurately?&#x20;
* Is it better to do one item in full, then repeat the process for the next item; or is it better to operate like a factory production line, repeating one task on every item, then repeating the next task on every item, until all are complete?&#x20;
* If you are interrupted for any reason, will you be able to remember where you had reached, and where & how to resume later?

These are the kinds of questions I think about before starting a larger task, such as sanitizing and refactoring datasets in Excel. Often, such datasets are large and apparently meaningless, so getting lost & confused is easily done.

Learn the shortcuts, plan the repetative sequences, consolidate them into muscle memory.

#### Actual automation

There are also actual automation solutions available — after all, this is a computer!&#x20;

* Windows has Task Scheduler built in, other OSes have similar options.&#x20;
* Microsoft Office has recordable macros in which you carry out a sequence of edits, which gets recorded and attached to a function, and the function can be started usually by a keyboard shortcut. I usually create an "insert new table row" macro bound to <mark style="color:yellow;">`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Enter`</mark>.
* IFTTT (If This Then That) allows for all kinds of automated tasks run via your personal internet accounts. I don't use it but it is exceptionally useful and highly featureful.
