## The Methods

I train my typing skills using three main methods.

### 1. Home keys

This is the [bog standard](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] typing method. Start from this concept in order to calibrate the position of your hands and finger movements.

[home-keys-method.md](home-keys-method.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

From here, try to develop touch-typing. This website is not for that.

This is where most people stop, but you can go further!

### 2. Rhythmic training

Once you are at a basic level with touch-typing, start practising with rhythmic key-presses.

Rhythmic typing allows your brain to become much more familiar with hitting the sequences of letters accurately. This is especially important if you are used to typing on a touchscreen with just your thumbs, and if you are used to having all your typos fixed by autocorrect.

As far as I'm aware, this is where most proficient typers stop developing their typing skills.

The next method is something that I developed on my own, and I haven't yet come across anyone else who does it.

### 3. Piano typing

I've developed my own way of typing that is akin to playing a piano.

On a computer keyboard, we are taught to hold our fingers over the home keys, yet on a piano, we adjust our hand positions continuously, always adapting for whichever notes have to be played next.

Regular typing on a computer is stable, but is too simplistic and often results in slow typing of certain words, especially words containing z, x, c, q, y; as well as sequences of letters like _lok_, _lik_, _ex_, etc.

Notice the enjoyably fluid experience of typing "power".

The method of typing "power" is very similar to playing a sequence of notes on a piano.

Take this concept and apply it to the computer keyboard â€” position your fingers such that every finger in the sequence of typing a word is in an ideal position.

Visit the [like-a-piano-method.md](like-a-piano-method.md "mention") page to learn the basic principles of this method and try it out with some example words!
