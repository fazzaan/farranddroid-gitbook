# Custom keyboard layouts

* MSKLC, pros & cons of custom keyboard layouts.
* Why I use custom keyboard layouts
  * even just for non-breaking space

I have created 5 custom keyboard layouts for the computer so far.&#x20;

I first created custom layouts to add more symbols, because I grew up using Linux, which utilizes the 3rd and 4th keyboard levels via the Alt Gr key. Moving to Windows for work purposes, I felt rather suffocated being unable to access these useful symbols straight from my keyboard.

1. A standard keyboard with added symbols, like arrows ↑←↓→, non-breaking space, etc.
2. A standard keyboard with symbols and IPA symbols.
3. A topographic IPA keyboard, with symbols organized by position in the mouth.
4. A custom Vietnamese layout, for the new Vietnamesealphabet that I created.
5. A standard QWERTY layout, for the new English alphabet that I created, repurposing the numbers.
