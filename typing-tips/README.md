## The Methods

I train my typing skills using three main methods.

### 1. Home keys

This is the [bog standard](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] typing method. Start from this concept in order to calibrate the position of your hands and finger movements.

From here, try to develop touch-typing. This website is not for that.

### 2. Rhythmic training

Once you are at a basic level with touch-typing, start practising with rhythmic key-presses.
