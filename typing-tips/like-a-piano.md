# Like a piano

I've developed a way of typing that is akin to playing a piano.

On a piano, we adjust our hand positions continuously, always adapting for whichever notes have to be played next.

On a computer keyboard, we are taught to hold our fingers over the home keys.

This is uncomfortably simplistic and often leads to slow typing of certain words, especially words containing z, x, c, q, y; as well as sequences of letters like lok, lik, etc.

Notice the enjoyably fluid experience of typing "power".

The method of typing "power" is very similar to playing a sequence of notes on a piano.

Take this concept and apply it to the computer keyboard — position your fingers such that every finger in the sequence of typing a word is in an ideal position.

## Principles

1. Get your thumbs involved! All 5 digits of the hand can be working together! Both thumbs for Space, left thumb for C and maybe V, right thumb for N and M.
2. Every key may be pressed by any finger or thumb. Different letter sequences may call for different digits to be used.&#x20;
3. More to add here — check my Google Sheet.



## Learning resources

I have produced a Google Sheet for training yourself with various words.
