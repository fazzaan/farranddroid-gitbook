WinCompose is an excellent piece of software. It allows you to designate a "compose" key on your keyboard, and after pressing it, you have a moment to type a series of keys, then WinCompose will output a letter or symbol that is usually a combination of the keys that you typed.

For example:

* o + c → ©
* \= + = → ≡
* \+ + + → #&#x20;
* f + f = ﬀ&#x20;
* \- + - + - = — (M-dash)
* t + m = ™
* etc.
