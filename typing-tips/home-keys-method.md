# Home Keys method

First you must learn how to use all your fingers and how to touch-type.

Touch-typing is not as hard as it sounds. It is just spatial awareness combined with muscle memory.&#x20;

Once you have learned that, start training rhythmically. This brings great improvement.

Once you are good at typing at a basic level, start practising typing [as if you are playing a piano](like-a-piano-method.md).
