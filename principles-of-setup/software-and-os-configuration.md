# Software & OS Configuration

These principles go for software configuration, but could also be applied to hardware selection.

1. As few distractions as possible, to maintain attention and activate flow state.
2. Similar shortcuts with each input device to achieve the same common tasks (window control etc).
3. Controls & shortcuts as intuitive as possible.
