# Back up everything you spend time creating

Ephemerality is a beautiful thing

In the world of computing, ideally most of us want to spend our time on _using_ the computer and _creating_ things with it, not _setting it up and tweaking it forever and ever_.

Back up your stuff to cloud storage.

* PowerToys can export your configuration as a file.&#x20;
  * Back it up.
* WinCompose has a custom sequences file.&#x20;
  * Back it up.
* Windows settings can be saved and synchronized with your Microsoft account.
  * Do that.
    * (Although there are issues to consider.)
* Microsoft Office can synchronize your language & proofing tools to your Office account.
  * Do that too.

All these backups can greatly increase the speed with which you set up your next computer, which could be necessary all of a sudden for all kinds of reasons!

* Unexpected hard-drive failure (SSDs are more prone to sudden failure)
* Theft or loss of device
* Accidental deletion
* Forgot password to computer
* Malware, spyware, viruses, hackers

Everyone thinks they're invincible until something happens unexpectedly that totally derails their workflow. If such a thing happens to you, you want to be ready to set up your new computer as swiftly and easily as possible!&#x20;

Back your stuff up!
