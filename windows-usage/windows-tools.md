# Windows Tools

There's actually a lot of tools built in to Windows these days that many people don't know about.

One of my favourites is the Clipboard.&#x20;

## Clipboard

Press <mark style="color:yellow;">`ðŸªŸ+V`</mark> to open the Clipboard popup panel. If you haven't used it before, you'll need to press "TurnÂ on" to activate it.

The Clipboard tool provides Clipboard history, and allows you to pin items.

The last item you pasted from Clipboard will become the item in your <mark style="color:yellow;">`Ctrl+V`</mark> clipboard too.
