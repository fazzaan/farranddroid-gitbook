# PowerToys Tools

PowerToys is an amazing set of freeware tools to extend and improve your experience of Windows.

The tools are intended for any kind of user who wants to customize their computer usage for specific purposes, and it goes a long way for making Linux users feel more at home.

I use several of the tools on a daily basis, they are indispensible to my workflow.

* [Color Picker â†´](powertoys-tools.md#color-picker)
* Keyboard Manager â†´ â€” remapping keys and shortcuts.
* Always On Top â†´
* Awake â†´

Others I use occasionally:

* Advanced Paste â€” features mainly useful for developers.
* FancyZones (largely deprecated by Windows 11's new snapping features)
* File Locksmith â€” for discovering which apps/processes are using a file and gaining access to it.
* Image Resizer
* Peek
* PowerRename â€” batch-rename files using rules, patterns and RegEx.
* PowerToys Run (like MacOS's Spotlight and Linux desktops' launchers.)
* Screen Ruler
* Text Extractor (you are recommended to use the text extraction feature in Snipping Tool instead.)

## Color Picker

I use Color Picker for my graphic design work.

Press ðŸªŸ+Shift+C to launch Color Picker.

Its settings page allows you to enable a wide range of colour format, as well as define your own.
